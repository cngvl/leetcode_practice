# Constraints:
    # 2 <= numbers.length <= 3 * 104
    # -1000 <= numbers[i] <= 1000
    # numbers is sorted in non-decreasing order.
    # -1000 <= target <= 1000
    # The tests are generated such that there is exactly one solution.

# For sure a TwoPointer question
# Question specifies to use constant extra space - Two Pointers should be fine in this case
# I think I should initialise one of the pointers at the END of the array
    # while left is < right
    # rightPointer iterates until numbers[rightPointer] is less than target
    # This works because there is exactly one solution, the two pointers should never cross anyway with the while loop condition
    # The hard part is figuring out which pointer to iterate inwards
    # if rightPointer + leftPointer = target, return [leftPointer + 1, rightPointer + 1]
    # elif? rightPointer - target is > leftPointer, then rightPointer -= 1?

# Initial thought process worked for 11/23 test cases + the example ones
# Oversight was the use of negative values ðŸ¥²
