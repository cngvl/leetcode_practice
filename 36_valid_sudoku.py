# Note:
    # A Sudoku board (partially filled) could be valid but is not necessarily solvable.
    # Only the filled cells need to be validated according to the mentioned rules.

# Constraints:
    # board.length == 9
    # board[i].length == 9
    # board[i][j] is a digit 1-9 or '.'.


# Three different 'rules' the board needs to pass before being confirmed as a valid board.
    # Can create three different methods
        # Checking each ROW for duplicates
        # Checking each COLOUMN for duplicates
        # Checking each 3 x 3 BOX for duplicates
            # Could've sorted out each of the 3 x 3 boxes as an individual value in itself
            # E.g. Columns 0 - 2 and Row 0 - 2 could be ONE box (use of mod 3)
