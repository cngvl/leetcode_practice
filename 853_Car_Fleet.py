    # All the values of position are unique.
    # 0 < speed[i] <= 106

# position and speed arrays of same length
# Can iterate through both at the same time and then add speed[i] to position[i]
# Stop looping once theres a pos[i] val that is >= target?
# maybe keep a max speed tracker to figure out whnen to stop looping
# Can do a final loop to check the number of fleets? - see how many vals are the same?Â¿
# Gets weird because there's also the no overtaking clause - can adjust the speed value?
# Question is listed as a Monotonic stack question - rock smashin type shit
