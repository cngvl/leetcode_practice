# Constraints:
# 0 <= digits.length <= 4
# digits[i] is a digit in the range ['2', '9'].

# Would this be considered to be a dynamic programming question?
# 'brute' force methoud would be to just loop through but then the issue comes with a variable number of digits being included
# Would this be considered to be more like a backtracking?Â¿
